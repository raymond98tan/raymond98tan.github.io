title: About me
---

- I graduated with a B.S. Informatics & Data Science degree at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in May 2020. Data science is concerned with making sense of unstructured or structured data throughout disciplines and domains including computer science, statistics, kinesiology, health, biology, and etc. Informatics encompasses how one can effectively make use of collected data for the sake of answering meaningful questions that are produced by natural phenomena, consumers, students, and researchers alike. Together, they both support my efforts to become a data scientist that is equipped to handle today’s ever-growing list of computational challenges.

- I am primarily interested in the technological, commercial, and FAccT (Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency) facets of data science and machine learning. I intend to use my studies to acquire skills and experiences that are comprehensive and practical. Ultimately, I will use them to support my academic and professional careers that follow.

- I am currently a student at Lambda School expanding my education to reach my goals in machine learning and data science.

- In my free time, I love to explore entrepreneurial avenues that make use of my skills through personal projects. Specifically, I enjoy developing tech venture ideas that target well-being and make things easier and more efficient for people. When I’m not doing that, I enjoy traveling, trying out new recipies, starting new shows, and breaking personal records at the gym!
