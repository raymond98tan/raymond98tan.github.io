Family Promise Spokane is a non-profit organization tackling the growing incidence of family homelessness in the Spokane, Washington area in an effort to provide resources to those in danger of not having their basic physiological needs met. As Family Promise Spokane has grown over the years to meet the needs of guests, their outdated intake forms and resource managements have struggled to keep up with the shelter's growth. To fight against the time-consuming labor requirements and insensitivity to the stresses that a written intake form puts on the shelterâ€™s guests, my team has worked to develop a digital intake solution to address the out of date system currently in place, as well as a dashboard management system. 

Not only were we providing case managers and supervisors the ability to process guests more efficiently, but also to implement machine learning into this system to better distribute resources to families. Specifically, we would build a machine learning application to predict the exit destination a familiy is most likely to enter into after transitioning from Family Promise Spokane. Entering into the project as an API builder and data analyst, I was tasked with working alongside my team to generate interpretable data visualizations from the model showcasing the reasoning behind why a family is predicted to exit where classified.
